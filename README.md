Simple Magic
============
Simple magic is a mod that I came up with in early 2012. I got the idea when I was watching a modding tutorial. Since then I have added lots of items and blocks, then I scraped everything and restarted. This is what I have added since the restart.

Most people say my coding style is, well, interesting, but it is a combination of the first style I learned and another style that I learned later on. It works for the mod, and for me. So stop your complaining! That said, if you want an explaination of anything, then please ask me, I will be happy to help.

Also none of this would be possible without the help of my friend Sudwood, he gave me the inspiration to start from scratch and continue modding. He is currently making his own "mystical" mod over at: https://github.com/Sudwood/Mystic-Additions/. I suggest you check it out.

If you want to download the mod and try it out then go here: http://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/simple-magic-v1/.

If you want to copy the code, then PLEASE ask my permission first, thank you.
